# Diabetes-Detection

In this repository, different supervised classification models were fit and tuned on a dataset created from a Behavorial Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) telephone survey. The best model was then used to create a web application using streamlit.

In addition, Tableau was used to create visualizations to help understand the target and feature variables in the dataset.

Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Ada Boost Classifier

Libraries/Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Pickle, Streamlit, Tableau
