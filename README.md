# Diabetes-Detection

Diabetes is among the most common chronic diseases in the United States impacting millions of Americans each year.

In this repository, different supervised classification models were fit and tuned on a dataset created from a Behavorial Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC and was made available on Kaggle. 

The CDC estimates that 1 in 5 diabetics, and roughly 8 in 10 pre-diabetics are unaware of their risk. Early diagnosis can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment. 

Using this dataset, predictive modeling seeks to assist in early detection. The best model was then used to create a web application using streamlit.

In addition, Tableau was used to create visualizations to help understand the target and feature variables in the dataset.

Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Ada Boost Classifier

Libraries/Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Pickle, Streamlit, Tableau
