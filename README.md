# Diabetes-Detection
Supervised machine learning models for Diabetes detection.

Models to apply:

Logistic Regression
* 19-Supervised-Machine-Learning
    * Day 1: Activity 5,  6 for basic logistic regression models
    * Day 1: Activity 7, 8 & Day 2: Activity 2, 3 for confusion matrix
    * Day 2 has activities on KNN, ROC curves, and SVM. Not sure if we will want to use these
    * Day 3: Random Forest: I think we likely want to include a random forest model. Good for health data.
